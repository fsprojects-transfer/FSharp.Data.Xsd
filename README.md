# FSharp.Data.Xsd

[FSharp.Data.Xsd](http://giacomociti.github.io/FSharp.Data.Xsd/) augments the XML type provider 
from [F# Data](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/) with schema support.

Please contribute, report issues and provide any kind of feedback.

## Project status and Roadmap

The XSD support is sufficiently complete. Before considering it ready for production, it is worth testing
it in real world use cases with as many schemas as possible.
Minor improvements (related to caching, error messages and support for primitive types) may hopefully be addressed
in the context of F# Data, because the end goal for this project is to get integrated into F# Data. 
In fact the implementation is directly based on its source code (thanks to [Paket GitHub references](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/github-dependencies.html)).

XML is in decline but many enterprises still use it heavily. That's why a type provider with schema support may help popularizing F# as a great tool also for boring line of business applications (BLOBAs).
