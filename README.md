# FSharp.Data.Xsd

[FSharp.Data.Xsd](http://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Data.Xsd/) augments the XML type provider 
of [F# Data](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/) with schema support.

XML is in decline but many enterprises still use it heavily. That's why a type provider with schema support may help popularizing F# as a great tool also for boring line of business applications (BLOBAs). 

## Project status and Roadmap

The XSD support is sufficiently complete and it's been also submitted as a [pull request to F# Data](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data/pull/1004).

## Maintainer(s)

The default maintainer account for projects under "fsprojects" is [@fsprojectsgit](https://github.com/fsprojectsgit) - F# Community Project Incubation Space (repo management)
